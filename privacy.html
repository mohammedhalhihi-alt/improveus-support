        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: January 20, 2026</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> We don't send any data to servers. All facial analysis and calorie tracking happens
            on your device. Your photos
            and health data never leave your phone.
        </div>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Improve Us ("the App") is designed with your privacy as the top priority. We believe your personal data
            should
            be completely private, which is why all processing happens locally on your device. Facial analysis uses
            Apple's Vision
            framework, and calorie tracking data is stored only on your device.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect or transmit any personal data.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>No photos are uploaded to any server</li>
            <li>No facial analysis results are stored remotely</li>
            <li>No health or calorie data is transmitted anywhere</li>
            <li>No analytics or tracking of any kind</li>
            <li>No third-party SDKs that collect data</li>
            <li>No account creation required</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>On-Device Processing</h2>
        <p>All facial analysis is performed entirely on your device using Apple's built-in Vision framework. When you
            select a photo:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The photo is processed locally on your iPhone/iPad</li>
            <li>Analysis results are generated on-device</li>
            <li>The photo is immediately discarded after analysis</li>
            <li>Nothing is transmitted over the internet</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Calorie Tracker Data</h2>
        <p>The calorie tracking feature stores personal health information locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> Gender, age, height, weight, target weight, activity level, and
                weight loss pace preferences</li>
            <li><strong>Food Logs:</strong> Daily food entries including foods consumed, serving sizes, and meal types
            </li>
            <li><strong>Custom Foods:</strong> Any custom foods you create</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This health data is stored only on your device using iOS's secure storage and is never transmitted to
                any server.</strong> You can delete all calorie tracker data at any time from the app's settings.</p>

        <h2>Local Storage</h2>
        <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whether you've accepted the Terms of Service (yes/no)</li>
            <li>Calorie tracker profile and food log data (if you use this feature)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data never leaves your device and is not backed up to iCloud.</p>

        <h2>Photo Access</h2>
        <p>The App requests access to your photo library to allow you to select photos for analysis. We only access the
            specific photos you choose. We cannot and do not access your entire photo library.</p>

        <h2>Camera Access</h2>
        <p>If you choose to take a photo within the App, we request camera access. Photos taken are processed on-device
            and are not saved unless you explicitly choose to save them.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is rated 12+/13+ (Teens) due to appearance-related content. We do not knowingly collect any
            information from anyone, including children.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not integrate any third-party services that collect user data.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
        </p>
